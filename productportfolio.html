				<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p>When we have skin issues we don’t know who to go to and we have the misconception it is always
					expensive and only certain income levels can have their needs met. I want to make it an equanimous
					platform by offering affordable healthcare.
					Our Target Customer: Patients who care about their skin
					Problem: Expensive and lack of transparency
					Solution: A platform where there is information about price, past patient reviews, information on
					what was treated, and billing done all in app.</p>

					reviews, and within my budget. Book appointment and pay on the application. My history will be saved

				<p>Profile: I work across many clinics and have my own business which I need to continually support

					bookings and also provide information of what treatment I provided. I expect easy to use since I’m
					not tech-savvy.<br><br>
