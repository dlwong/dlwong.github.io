				<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p>When we have skin issues we don’t know who to go to and we have the misconception it is always
					expensive and only certain income levels can have their needs met. I want to make it an equanimous
					platform by offering affordable healthcare.
					Our Target Customer: Patients who care about their skin
					Problem: Expensive and lack of transparency
					Solution: A platform where there is information about price, past patient reviews, information on
					what was treated, and billing done all in app.</p>

				<p>Profile: I work across many clinics and have my own business which I need to continually support

					not tech-savvy.<br><br>

				<h2>Product Roadmap</h2>
				<img src="images/productRoadmap.png" />
				<h2>Risk and Mitigation</h2>
				<p>
					Schedule Risk: There might be conflict when scheduling/allocating critical engineering resources,
					leading to product launch delays.
					Mitigation: The team will need to follow the Agile principle and give onboarding training on Agile
					expectations.
				</p>
				<p>
					Business Risk: There might be fewer patient requests than the team expected.
					Mitigation: Use a landing page and “The Mechanical Turk” to start the business before investing too
					much in technology.
				<p>
					Operational Risk: The un-uniform customer volume may cause too much waste for some seasons or days.
					Mitigation: Start the business with the smallest size to experience the market. Increase/reduce
					operation team size using forecasting data.
				</p>
				<p>
					Market Risk
					STO (is a new concept to most investors, it hasn’t been around long enough to prove its value in the
					market yet

					Create/publish blogs on company website and co-create content with industry influencers
				</p>
				<p>
					Technology Risk: The infrastructure of the app might require too much overhead.
					Mitigation: The design should start with cloud deployment before owning any infrastructure.
				</p>
				<p>
					Legal Risk: The privacy concern may pose the team a legal risk.
					Mitigation: The company will partner with government. All privacy rules will need an external legal
					team review.
