					<h2>Overview</h2>
				</header>
				<p>When we have skin issues we don’t know who to go to and we have the misconception it is always
					expensive and only certain income levels can have their needs met. I want to make it an equanimous
					platform by offering affordable healthcare.</p>
				<p><b>Our Target Customer:</b> Patients who care about their skin</p>
				<p><b>Problem:</b> Expensive and lack of transparency</p>
				<p><b>Solution:</b> A platform where there is information about price, past patient reviews, information
					on
					what was treated, and billing done all in app.</p>

				<header class="major">
					<h2>Risk and Mitigation</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					<b>Schedule Risk:</b> There might be conflict when scheduling/allocating critical engineering
					resources, leading to product launch delays
					<b>Mitigation:</b> The team will need to follow the Agile principle (daily stand-ups, 2-week sprint
					cycle) to ensure cross-functional teams are sync
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Business Risk:</b> There might be fewer patient sign-ups than the team expected </br>
					<b>Mitigation:</b> Invest in marketing before building and have a “The Mechanical Turk” to start the
					business.
				<p>
					<b>Operational Risk:</b> There could be technical issues (e.g. app crashes)</br>
					<b>Mitigation:</b> The team will have alerts on any errors that seem irregular
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Market Risk:</b> User engagement may be low</br>
					<b>Mitigation:</b> The team will continuously make improvements and release new features to make
					sure users are engaged and cannot live without the app
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Technology Risk:</b> The infrastructure of the app might require too much overhead</br>
					<b>Mitigation:</b> The team will always be cognizant of keeping up to date with the latest
					technology to keep infrastructure up to date and will build what is necessary to capture at least
					80% of the market
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Legal Risk:</b> The data privacy concern may pose the team a legal risk</br>
					<b>Mitigation:</b> The team will work closely with legal team to make sure there is no exposure of
					any legal repercussions
